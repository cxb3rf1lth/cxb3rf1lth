🚨 **Welcome to CyberFilth** 🚨
🕸️ *Born of filth. Bound by fire. Forged for war.*

This is the unholy sanctuary for hackers of all shades — from baby scriptkiddies writing their first `nmap` scan to seasoned red team demons dropping custom implants like it's a Tuesday.And apart from all things hacking and cyber security, you will also find passion projects and self made tooling or code unrelated to cyber security(like our native darktube cli yt scraper). All are welcome here. All are *needed* here.

💀 **CyberFilth isn't a project. It's a movement.**
A swarm. A rebellion. A syndicate for those who want to *build, break, and burn the digital cancer* — scammers, predators, and cyber criminals who hide behind keyboards and prey on the innocent.

🧠 Learn. 🔧 Contribute. 🔥 Wreck.

---

🎯 **What We Do:**

* Build tools to hunt and expose scammers
* Drop exploits on predator forums
* Train noobs into warlords
* Weaponize code into justice
* Operate anonymously, surgically, vigilantly

---

🛡️ **Operations & Campaigns**

* `#OpBlackout`: Takedowns on phishing gangs & fake tech support ops
* `#ProjectReckoning`: Profile & target online predators using OSINT + implants
* `#ScamHunterX`: Decoy traps, reverse scams, financial bleed-outs

---

👁‍•◆ **Join the vigilante grid.**
We are not waiting for permission. We are not playing defense.
We're rewriting the rules — one payload at a time.

**Fork. Clone. Build. Break. Fight.**
Welcome to the filth. You’re one of us now.
